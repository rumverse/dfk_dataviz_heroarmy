Serendale Hero Army 

This is to enable all citizens of DFK to see how big Gaia's hero army is, what is its value and what exactly is it composed of. 

The objectives are:

1. To see not only the TVL but also Hero Jewel Value.
2. Understand what classes are there and what levels they are in.
3. Gain some visibility who owns the most heroes and most valuable hero owners.

The data visualization is in two parts:

1. Python script to consume the DFK's hero catalog and floor price of Kingdom.watch. This was done in 577 requests, so no servers are harmed during the process. 
2. The data visualization was done in Google Data Studio (https://datastudio.google.com/s/oLrKHbkotuQ)

What's next?

1. The report data can be updated (script - https://github.com/rumverse/dfk_dataviz_heroarmy)
2. This was designed so it can be used potentially for Crystalvale, Guilds and other data segments to understand an army composition and value
